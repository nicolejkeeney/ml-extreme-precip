# ml-extreme-precip

This project attempts to reproduce the analysis performed in [Davenport & Diffenbaugh (2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL093787) for the state of Colorado, using a random forest instead of a convolutional neural network. The input data is daily anomalies of sea level pressure and geopotential height at 500 hPa from [NCEP-NCAR Renanalysis-1](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html), along with IMERG precipitation estimates. Random forest code builds upon the code repository from Elizabeth Barnes' machine learning course, specifically the notebook [rf_regress_christman.ipynb](https://github.com/eabarnes1010/course_ml_ats/blob/main/code/rf_regress_christman.ipynb)
